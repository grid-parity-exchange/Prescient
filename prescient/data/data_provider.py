        Notes

        requested time steps, only those steps for which there is sufficient storage
        will be saved.  If arrays are larger than the number of requested time 
        steps, the remaining array elements will be left unchanged.

        steps, the remaining array elements will be left unchanged.

        Actuals data is always taken from the file matching the date of the time step.
        In other words, only the first 24 hours of each actuals file will ever be
        used.  If this isn't what you want, you'll need to handle that yourself.
