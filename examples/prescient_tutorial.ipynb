    "This is a tutorial to demonstration the basic functionality of Prescient. Please follow the installation instructions in the [README](https://github.com/grid-parity-exchange/Prescient/blob/master/README.md) before proceeding. This tutorial will assume we are using the CBC MIP solver, however, we will point out where one could use a different solver (CPLEX, Gurobi, Xpress). For larger systems, a commerical MIP solver is recommended."

    "## Sample 5-bus case\n",
    "We will use the example 5-bas case that comes with Prescient. This example is in the \"rts-gmlc\" format for Prescient, which designed to be compatable with the RTS-GMLC dataset (publically available [here](https://github.com/GridMod/RTS-GMLC)). To find out more about the RTS-GMLC system, or if you use the RTS-GMLC system in published research, please see or cite the [RTS-GMLC paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8753693&isnumber=4374138&tag=1).\n",
    "\n",
    "The format is defined as a collection of csv files, devided into \"static\" system data and time-varing system data. The static data include branches (`branch.csv`), buses (`bus.csv`), generators (`gen.csv`), initial generator status (`initial_status.csv`), reserves (`reserves.csv`). The file `timeseries_pointers.csv` links static attributes defined in the aforementioned files to time-varying attributes, for quantities such as load, reserve requirement, and renewables output. Critically, Prescient requires both a day-ahead time series, which serves as a forecasted value for the day-ahead unit commitment problem, and a real-time time series, which is uses as the realized values in the real-time economic dispatch problem. The file `simulation_objects.csv` provides metadata on the time series data, such as begin date, end date, and the temporal resolution.\n",
