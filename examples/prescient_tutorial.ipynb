Please follow the installation instructions in the [README](https://github.com/grid-parity-exchange/Prescient/blob/master/README.md) before proceeding.

    "Description of the options included are as follows:\n",
    " - `--data-directory`: Where the source data is (same as outputs for the populator).\n",
    " - `--simulate-out-of-sample`: This option directs the simulator to use different forecasts from actuals. Without it, the simulation is run with forecasts equal to actuals\n",
    " - `--run-sced-with-persistent-forecast-errors`: This option directs the simulator to use forecasts (adjusted by the current forecast error) for sced look-ahead periods, instead of using the actuals for sced look-ahead periods.\n",
    " - `--output-directory`: Where to write the output data.\n",
    " - `--run-deterministic-ruc`: Directs the simualtor to run a deterministic (as opposed to stochastic) unit commitment problem. Required for now as stochastic unit commitment is currently deprecated.\n",
    " - `--start-date`: Day to start the simulation on. Must be in the data-directory.\n",
    " - `--num-days`: Number of days to simulate, including the start date. All days must be included in the data-directory.\n",
    " - `--sced-horizon`: Number of look-ahead periods (in hours) for the real-time economic dispatch problem.\n",
    " - `--traceback`: If enabled, the simulator will print a trace if it failed.\n",
    " - `--random-seed`: Unused currently.\n",
    " - `--output-sced-initial-conditions`: Prints the initial conditions for the economic dispatch problem to the screen.\n",
    " - `--output-sced-demands`: Prints the demands for the economic dispatch problem to the screen.\n",
    " - `--output-sced-solutions`: Prints the solution for the economic dispatch problem to the screen.\n",
    " - `--output-ruc-initial-conditions`: Prints the initial conditions for the unit commitment problem to the screen.\n",
    " - `--output-ruc-solutions`: Prints the commitment solution for the unit commitment problem to the screen.\n",
    " - `--output-ruc-dispatches`: Prints the dispatch solution for the unit commitment problem to the screen.\n",
    " - `--output-solver-logs`: Prints the logs from the optimization solver (CBC, CPLEX, Gurobi, Xpress) to the screen.\n",
    " - `--ruc-mipgap`: Optimality gap to use for the unit commitment problem. Default is 1% used here -- can often be tighted for commerical solvers.\n",
    " - `--symbolic-solver-labels`: If set, `symbolic_solver_labels` is used when writing optimization models from Pyomo to the solver. Only useful for low-level debugging.\n",
    " - `--reserve-factor`: If set, overwrites any basic reserve factor included in the test data.\n",
    " - `--deterministic-ruc-solver`: The optimization solver ('cbc', 'cplex', 'gurobi', 'xpress') used for the unit commitment problem.\n",
    " - `--sced-solver`: The optimization solver ('cbc', 'cplex', 'gurobi', 'xpress') used for the economic dispatch problem.\n",

    "Other options not included in this file, which may be useful:\n",
    " - `--compute-market-settlements`: (True/False) If enabled, solves a day-ahead pricing problem (in addition to the real-time pricing problem) and computes generator revenue based on day-ahead and real-time prices.\n",
    " - `--day-ahead-pricing`: ('LMP', 'ELMP', 'aCHP') Specifies the type of day-ahead price to use. Default is 'aCHP'.\n",
    " - `--price-threashold`: The maximum value for the energy price ($/MWh). Useful for when market settlements are computed to avoid very large LMP values when load shedding occurs.\n",
    " - `--reserve-price-threashold`: The maximum value for the reserve price (\\$/MW). Useful for when market settlements are computed to avoid very large LMP values when reserve shortfall occurs.\n",
    " - `--deterministic-ruc-solver-options`: Options to pass into the unit commitment solver (specific to the solver used) for every unit commitment solve.\n",
    " - `--sced-solver-options`: Options to pass into the economic dispatch solve (specific to the solver used) for every economic dispatch solve.\n",
