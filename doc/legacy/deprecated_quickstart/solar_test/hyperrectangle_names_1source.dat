# - Patterns start with the keyword "Pattern" followed by a colon, a whitespace and the name of the pattern.
# - The hyperrectangles belonging to this pattern must be listed below, each hyperractangle in a new line starting
#   with "-", followed by the hyperrectangle's name, a whitespace and the intervals in the order of the sources as
#   defined above, separated by whitespaces.
# - An interval must be written as "(x,y)", where "x" defines the lower and "y" the upper bound. The bounds cannot have
#   more than four decimal places.
# - Every hyperrectangle of one pattern must be either disjoint to all other hyperrectangles of this pattern, or a
#   proper subset of an other hyperrectangle. If a hyperrectangle contains a proper subset, the subset is subtracted
#   from the hyperrectangle.
