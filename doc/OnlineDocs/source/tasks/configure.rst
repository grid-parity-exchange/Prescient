Configuration Options
=====================

.. contents::
   :local:

Overview
--------

Prescient configuration options are used to indicate how 
the Prescient simulation should be run. Configuration
options can be specified on the command line, in a text
configuration file, or in code, depending on how Prescient
is launched (see :doc:`run`).

Each configuration option has a name, a data type, and a default value.
The name used on the command line and the name used in code vary slightly.
For example, the number of days to simulate is specified as `\-\-num-days`
on the command line, and `num_days` in code. 

Option Data Types
-----------------

Most options use self-explanatory data types like `String`,
`Integer`, and `Float`, but some data types require more
explanation and may be specified in code in ways that are unavailable 
on the command line:

.. list-table:: Configuration Data Types
   :header-rows: 1
   :class: table-top-align-cells table-wrap-headers

   * - Data type
     - Command-line/config file usage
     - In-code usage
   * - Path
     - A text string that refers to a file or folder. Can be
       relative or absolute, and may include special characters
       such as `~`.
     - Same as command-line
   * - Date
     - A string that can be converted to a date, such as *1776-07-04*.
     - Either a string or a datetime object.
   * - Flag
     - Simply include the option to set it to true. For example, the command
       below sets `simulate_out_of_sample` to true::

         runner.py --simulate-out-of-sample

     - Set the option by assigning True or False::

         config.simulate_out_of_sample = True
   * - Module
     - Refer to a python module in one of the following ways:

       * The name of a python module (such as `prescient.simulator.prescient`)
       * The path to a python file (such as `prescient/simulator/prescient.py`)
     - In addition to the two string options available to the command-line, 
       code may also use a python module object. For example::
         
         import my_custom_data_provider
         config.data_provider = my_custom_data_provider

     - Path to a file holding configuration options. Can be absolute or
       relative. Cannot be set in code directly on a configuration object, but
       can be passed to a configuration object's `parse_args()` function:

       .. code-block:: python

          p = Prescient()
          p.config.parse_args(["--config-file", "my-config.txt"])
